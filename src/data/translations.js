The process reflects the Center’s mission to strengthen families, protect the sanctity of marriage, and foster stable households grounded in faith and moral integrity.",

            para2: "وفقاً للمبادئ الأساسية والقيم الإسلامية الموضحة في اللوائح الداخلية لمركز الإيمان الإسلامي، يتم إجراء جميع عقود الزواج التي ييسرها المركز مع التزام راسخ بدعم الشريعة الإسلامية، والحفاظ على حقوق وواجبات كلا الزوجين، وتعزيز العدالة والشفافية والاحترام المتبادل. تعكس هذه العملية رسالة المركز في تقوية الأسر وحماية قدسية الزواج وتعزيز بيوت مستقرة تقوم على الإيمان والنزاهة الأخلاقية.",
            para3: "يضمن مركز الإيمان الإسلامي تنفيذ كل عقد زواج بشكل صحيح وبضمير حي، مع الاعتراف الواضح بالعناصر المطلوبة مثل الولاية الشرعية (الولي)، والقبول المتبادل (الإيجاب والقبول)، والمهر المتفق عليه (المهر)، والشهود الموثوق بهم، مع تشجيع الأزواج أيضاً على فهم مسؤولياتهم المشتركة أمام الله.",
            para4: "من خلال هذه الخدمة، يسعى مركز الإيمان الإسلامي إلى دعم الزيجات التي تجسد الأخلاق الإسلامية، وتساهم بشكل إيجابي في المجتمع، وتكون بمثابة أساس لعائلات قوية واعية لله للأجيال القادمة."
